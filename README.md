# ascii_camera
A simple program to create an ascii text out of your webcam's video feed.

## Example:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/cGHuaoY.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## How to use it:
```
git clone https://github.com/saravenpi/ascii_camera
cd ascii_camera
npm install
npm start
```
## More about it:
The ascii text may not fit in your terminal, in order to fix that you may want to zoom out in your terminal until the text fits correctly inside of it.
